Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified
layer 3 routing. Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity
have led many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP as their single routing
protocol for both their fabric routing and their Data Center Interconnect
(DCI) routing. This document describes extentions to BGP to use BGP
Link-State distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm similar
to Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF. In doing this, it allows
BGP to be efficiently used as both the underlay protocol and the overlay protocol in
MSDCs.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified
layer 3 routing. Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity
have led many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>
as their single routing protocol for both their fabric routing and
their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing <xref target="RFC7938"/>.
This document describes an alternative solution which leverages
BGP-LS <xref target="RFC7752"/> and the Shortest Path First algorithm similar
to Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/>.
</t>
<t>This document leverages both the BGP protocol <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
the BGP-LS <xref target="RFC7752"/> protocols. The relationship, as well as,
the scope of changes are described respectively in <xref target="BGP-base"/>
and <xref target="BGP-LS"/>. The modifications to <xref target="RFC4271"/>
for BGP SPF described herein only apply to the IPv4 and IPv6 as underlay unicast
Subsequent Address Families Indentifiers (SAFIs).
Operations for any other BGP SAFIs are outside the scope of this document.
</t>
<t>
This solution avails the benefits of both BGP and SPF-based IGPs.
These include TCP based flow-control, no periodic link-state refresh, and
completely incremental NLRI advertisement. These advantages can reduce the
overhead in MSDCs where there is a high degree of Equal Cost Multi-Path
(ECMPs) and the topology is very stable.
Additionally, using an SPF-based computation can support fast convergence and
the computation of Loop-Free Alternatives (LFAs). The SPF LFA extensions defined
in <xref target="RFC5286"/> can be similarily applied to the BGP SPF.
However, the details are a matter of implementation detail.
Furthermore, a BGP based solution lends itself to multiple peering models
including those incorporating route-reflectors <xref target="RFC4456"/>
or controllers.
</t>
<section title="Terminology">
  <t>This specification reuses terms defined in section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>
  including BGP speaker, NLRI, and Route.</t>
  <t>Additionally, this document introduces the following terms:
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="BGP SPF Routing Domain:"> A set of BGP routers that are under a single
    administrative domain and are link-state information using the BGP-LS-SPF information
    and computing routes using BGP SPF as described herein.</t>
    <t hangText="BGP-LS-SPF NLRI:"> This refers to BGP-LS Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) that is being advertised in the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI (<xref target="SAFI"/>)
    and is being used for BGP SPF route computation.</t>
  </list></t>
</section>
<section title="BGP Shortest Path First (SPF) Motivation">
<t>
Given that <xref target="RFC7938"/> already describes how BGP could be used
as the sole routing protocol in an MSDC, one might question the motivation for
defining an alternate BGP deployment model when a mature solution exists.
For both alternatives, BGP offers the operational benefits of a single
routing protocol as opposed to the combination of an IGP for the underlay
and BGP as an overlay. However, BGP SPF offers some unique advantages above
and beyond standard BGP distance-vector routing. With BGP SPF, the standard
hop-by-hop peering model is relaxed.
</t>
<t>
A primary advantage is that all BGP-LS-SPF speakers in the BGP SPF routing domain
will have a complete view of the topology. This will allow support for ECMP,
IP fast-reroute (e.g., Loop-Free Alternatives), Shared Risk Link Groups
(SRLGs), and other routing enhancements without advertisement of additional
BGP paths <xref target="RFC7911"/>  or other extensions. In short, the advantages
of an IGP such as OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/> are availed in BGP.
</t>
<t>
  With the simplified BGP decision process as defined in
  <xref target="bgp-decision"/>, NLRI changes can be disseminated throughout the BGP
  routing domain much more rapidly (equivalent to IGPs with the proper
  implementation).
</t>
<t>
Another primary advantage is a potential reduction in NLRI advertisement.
With standard BGP distance-vector routing, a single link failure may impact
100s or 1000s prefixes and result in the withdrawal or re-advertisement of
the attendant NLRI. With BGP SPF, only the BGP speakers corresponding to
the link NLRI need withdraw the corresponding BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI. Additionally,
the changed NLRI will be advertised immediately as opposed to normal BGP where it
is only advertised after the best-path selection. These advantages will afford
NLRI dissemination throughout the BGP SPF routing domain with efficiencies similar
to link-state protocols.
</t>
<t>
With controller and route-reflector peering models, BGP SPF advertisement
and distributed computation require a minimal number of sessions and
copies of the NLRI since only the latest version of the NLRI from the
originator is required. Given that verification of the adjacencies is done
outside of BGP (see <xref target="peering-models"/>), each BGP speaker will
only need as many sessions and copies of the NLRI as required for
redundancy (see <xref target="peering-models"/>).
Additionally, a controller could inject topology that
is learned outside the BGP SPF routing domain.
</t>
<t>
Given that controllers are already consuming BGP-LS-SPF NLRI
<xref target="RFC7752"/>, this functionality can be reused for BGP-LS-SPF NLRI.
</t>
<t>
Another potential advantage of BGP SPF is that both IPv6 and IPv4 can both
be supported using BGP-LS-SPF SAFI using the same BGP-LS-SPF NLRIs. In many
MSDC fabrics, the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies are congruent.
Although beyond the scope of this document, multi-topology extensions could
be used to support separate IPv4, IPv6, unicast, and multicast topologies
while sharing the same NLRI.
</t>
<t>
Finally, the BGP SPF topology can be used as an underlay for other BGP
SAFIs (using the existing model) and realize all the above
advantages.
</t>
</section>
      <section title="Document Overview">
<t>
  The document begins with sections defining the precise relationship that BGP SPF has
  with both the base BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>  (<xref target="BGP-base"/>) and the
  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS)  extensions <xref target="RFC7752"/>
  (<xref target="BGP-LS"/>). This is required to dispel the
  notion that BGP SPF is an independent protocol. The BGP peering models as well as the
  their respective trade-offs are then discussed in
  <xref target="peering-models"/>. The remaining sections, which make up the bulk of the
  document, define the protocol enhancements necessary to support BGP SPF. The BGP-LS extensions are
  defined in <xref target="protocol-extend"/>. The replacement of the base BGP decision process
  is defined in <xref target="bgp-decision"/>. Finally, BGP SPF error handling is defined in
  <xref target="error-handling"/>
</t>
</section>
      <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
        when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
       </section>
</section> <!-- for Introductions section -->


<section anchor="BGP-base" title="Base BGP Relationship">
  <t>
    With the exception of the decision process, the BGP SPF extensions leverage the BGP
    protocol <xref target="RFC4271"/>  without change. This includes the BGP protocol
    Finite State Machine, BGP messages and the message formats, processing of BGP messages,
    BGP attributes and path attributes, BGP NLRI encodings, and any error handling
    defined in the <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
    <xref target="RFC7606"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    Due to the changes to the decision
    process, there are mechanisms and encodings that are no longer applicable.
    While not necessarily required for computation, the ORIGIN, AS_PATH,
    MULTI_EXIT_DISC, LOCAL_PREF, and NEXT_HOP path attributes are mandatory and will
    be validated. The ATOMIC_AGGEGATE, and AGGREGATOR are not applicable within the
    context of BGP SPF and SHOULD NOT be advertised. However, if they are advertised,
    they will be accepted, validated,
    and propagated consistent with the BGP protocol.
  </t>
  <t>
    Section 9 of <xref target="RFC4271"/> defines the
    Decision Process that is used to select routes for subsequent advertisement
    by applying the policies in the local Policy Information Base (PIB) to the
    routes stored in its Adj-RIBs-In. The output of the Decision Process is the
    set of routes that are announced by a BGP speaker to its peers. These
    selected routes are stored by a BGP speaker in the speaker's Adj-RIBs-Out
    according to policy.
  </t>
  <t>
    The BGP SPF extension fundamentally changes the decision process, as described
    herein, to be more like a link-state protocol
    (e.g., OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/>).  Specifically:
    <list style="numbers">
      <t>
	BGP advertisements are readvertised to neighbors immediately without waiting
	or dependence on the route computation as specified in phase 3 of the base BGP
	decision process. Multiple peering models are supported as specified in
	<xref target="peering-models"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	Determining the degree of preference for BGP routes for the SPF calculation as
	described in phase 1 of the base BGP decision process is replaced with the mechanisms
	in <xref target="Phase-1"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	Phase 2 of the base BGP protocol decision process is replaced with the
	Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, also known as the Dijkstra algorithm.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section> <!-- for BGP relationship section -->

<section anchor="BGP-LS" title="BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) Relationship">
<t>
 <xref target="RFC7752"/> describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information can
 be collected from networks and shared with external entities using BGP.
 This is achieved by defining NLRI advertised using the BGP-LS AFI. The BGP-LS extensions defined in
 <xref target="RFC7752"/> make use of the Decision Process defined in
 <xref target="RFC4271"/>.  This document reuses NLRI and TLVs defined in <xref target="RFC7752"/>.
 Rather than reusing the BGP-LS SAFI, the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI
 <xref target="SAFI"/> is introduced to insure backward compatibility for the BGP-LS SAFI usage.
</t>
<t>
  The BGP SPF entensions reuse the Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI defined
  in <xref target="RFC7752"/>.  The usage of the BGP-LS
  NLRI, metric attributes, and attribute extensions is described in
  <xref target="NLRI-Use"/>. The usage of others BGP-LS attributes is not precluded and is,
  in fact, expected. However, the details are beyond the scope of this document and will be
  specified in future documents.
</t>
<t>
  Support for Multiple Topology Routing (MTR) similar to the OSPF MTR computation described in
  <xref target="RFC4915"/> is beyond the scope of this document. Consequently, the usage of the
  Multi-Topology TLV as described in section 3.2.1.5 of <xref target="RFC7752"/> is not specified.
</t>
<t>
  The rules for setting the NLRI next-hop path attribute for the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI will follow
  the BGP-LS SAFI as specified in section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC7752"/>.
</t>
</section> <!-- for BGP-LS relationship section -->

<section anchor="peering-models" title="BGP Peering Models">
<t>
  Depending on the topology, scaling, capabilities of the BGP-LS-SPF speakers, and redundancy
  requirements, various peering models are supported. The only requirements are that all BGP
  SPF speakers in the BGP SPF routing domain receive BGP-LS-SPF NLRI, run an SPF calculation,
  and update their routing table appropriately.
</t>
<section title="BGP Single-Hop Peering on Network Node Connections">
<t>
  The simplest peering model is the one where
  EBGP single-hop sessions are established over direct point-to-point links
  interconnecting the nodes in the BGP SPF routing domain. Once the single-hop BGP session has been
  established and the BGP-LS/BGP-LS-SPF AFI/SAFI capability has been exchanged
  <xref target="RFC4760"/> for the corresponding session, then the link is considered up from
  a BGP SPF prespective and the corresponding BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised.
  If the session goes down, the corresponding Link NLRI will be withdrawn. Topologically,
  this would be equivalent to the peering model in <xref target="RFC7938"/> where there
  is a BGP session on every link in the data center switch fabric.  The content of the Link NLRI
  is described in <xref target="Link-NLRI"/>.
</t>
</section>
<section title="BGP Peering Between Directly-Connected Nodes">
<t>
In this model, BGP-LS-SPF speakers peer with all directly-connected
nodes but the sessions may be between loopback addresses (i.e.,
two-hop sessions) and the direct connection
discovery and liveliness detection for the interconnecting links are
independent of the BGP protocol. How this is accomplished is outside
the scope of this document. For example, liveliness detection could be
done using the BFD protocol <xref target="RFC5880"/>.
Consequently, there will be a single BGP session even if there are multiple
direct connections between BGP-LS-SPF speakers. BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised
as long as a BGP session has been established, the BGP-LS/BGP-LS-SPF AFI/SAFI
capability has been exchanged <xref target="RFC4760"/>, and
the link is operational as determined using liveliness detection mechanisms
outside the scope of this document.
This is much like the previous peering model only peering is between
loopback addresses and the interconnecting links can be unnumbered. However,
since there are BGP sessions between every directly-connected node in the
network, there is only a reduction in BGP sessions when there are parallel
links between nodes.
</t>
</section>
<section title="BGP Peering in Route-Reflector or Controller Topology">
<t>
  In this model, BGP-LS-SPF speakers peer solely with one or more Route Reflectors
  <xref target="RFC4456"/> or controllers. As in the previous model, direct
  connection discovery and liveliness detection for those connections are
  done outside of the BGP protocol.
  BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised as long as the corresponding link is
  considered up as per the chosen liveness detection mechanism.
</t>
<t>
  This peering model, known as sparse peering, allows for fewer BGP sessions
  and, consequently, fewer instances of the same NLRI received from multiple peers.
  Normally, the route-reflectors or controller BGP sessions would be on directly-connected
  links to avoid dependence on another routing protocol for session connectivity. However,
  multi-hop peering is not precluded. The number of BGP sessions is dependent
  on the redundancy requirements and the stability of the BGP sessions. This is
  discussed in greater detail in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lsvr-applicability"/>.

<section anchor="protocol-extend" title="BGP Shortest Path Routing (SPF) Protocol Extensions">
  <section anchor="SAFI" title="BGP-LS Shortest Path Routing (SPF) SAFI">
    <t>
      In order to replace the exiting BGP decision process with an SPF-based Decision Process
      in a backward compatible manner by not impacting the BGP-LS SAFI, this document
      introduces the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI.
      The BGP-LS-SPF (AFI 16388 / SAFI 80) <xref target="RFC4760"/> is allocated by IANA
      as specified in the <xref target="IANA"/>.
      In order for two BGP-LS-SPF speakers to exchange BGP SPF NLRI, they MUST exchange
      the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> <xref target="RFC4760"/>
      to ensure that they are both capable of properly processing such NLRI.  This is done with
      AFI 16388 / SAFI 80 for BGP-LS-SPF advertised with the BGP SPF Routing Domain.
      The BGP-LS-SPF SAFI is used to carry
      IPv4 and IPv6 prefix information in a format that is easier to calculate SPF-based
      Decision Process.
    </t>

    <section anchor="BGP-LS-TLV" title="BGP-LS-SPF NLRI TLVs">
      <t>
	The NLRI format of BGP-LS-SPF SAFI uses exactly same format of BGP-LS AFI
	<xref target="RFC7752"/>. In other words,
	all the TLVs used in BGP-LS AFI are applicable and used for BGP-LS-SPF SAFI. These
	TLVs within BGP-LS-SPF NLRI carries information that describes links, nodes, and
	prefixes comprising IGP link-state information.
      </t>

      <t>

The criteria for advertisement of Link NLRI are discussed in
<xref target="peering-models"/>.
</t>
<t>
Link NLRI is advertised with local and remote node descriptors as described
above and unique link identifiers dependent on the addressing. For IPv4 links, the
links local IPv4 (TLV 259) and remote IPv4 (TLV 260) addresses will be used.
For IPv6 links, the local IPv6 (TLV 261) and remote IPv6 (TLV 262) addresses
will be used. For unnumbered links, the link local/remote identifiers (TLV 258)
will be used. For links supporting having both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both sets
of descriptors may be included in the same Link NLRI. The link identifiers are
described in table 5 of <xref target="RFC7752"/>.
</t>
<t>
  For a link to be used in Shortest Path Tree (SPT) for a given address family,
  i.e., IPv4 or IPv6, both routers connecting the link MUST have an address in the
  same subnet for that address family. However, an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix associated
  with the link MAY be installed without the corresponding address on the other
  side of link.
</t>
<t>
  The link IGP metric attribute TLV (TLV 1095) MUST be advertised. If a BGP speaker
  receives a Link NLRI without an IGP metric attribute TLV, than it SHOULD consider
  the received NLRI as a malformed and the receiving BGP speaker MUST handle such
  malformed NLRI as 'Treat-as-withdraw' <xref target="RFC7606"/>.
  The BGP SPF metric length is 4 octets.
  Like OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/>, A cost is associated with the output side of each
  router interface.  This cost is configurable by the system administrator.  The
  lower the cost, the more likely the interface is to be used to forward data traffic.
  One possible default for metric would be to give each interface a cost of 1
  making it effectively a hop count.
  Algorithms such as setting the metric inversely to the link speed as done in the
  OSPF MIB <xref target="RFC4750"/> MAY be supported. However, this is beyond the scope

<t>
Sequence Number <vspace blankLines="1" />
The 64-bit strictly increasing sequence number is incremented for every
version of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI originated. BGP speakers implementing this specification MUST use
available mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing property
for the deployed life of the BGP speaker (including cold restarts).
One mechanism for accomplishing this would be to use the high-order 32 bits of the
sequence number as a wrap/boot count that is incremented anytime the BGP router
loses its sequence number state or the low-order 32 bits wrap.
</t>
<t>
When incrementing the sequence number for each self-originated NLRI,
the sequence number should be treated as an unsigned 64-bit
value. If the lower-order 32-bit value wraps, the higher-order 32&nbhy;bit value should
be incremented and saved in non-volatile storage. If by some chance the BGP-LS-SPF speaker is
deployed long enough that there is a possibility that the 64-bit sequence number may wrap
or a BGP-LS-SPF speaker completely loses its sequence number state (e.g., the BGP speaker hardware
is replaced or experiences a cold-start), the phase 1 decision function
(see <xref target="Phase-1"/>) rules will insure convergence, albeit, not immediately.
</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="bgp-decision" title="Decision Process with SPF Algorithm">
<t>
The Decision Process described in <xref target="RFC4271"/> takes place in
three distinct phases. The Phase 1 decision function of the Decision Process is
responsible for calculating the degree
of preference for each route received from a BGP speaker's peer. The Phase 2 decision
function is invoked on completion of the Phase 1 decision function and is responsible
for choosing the best route out of all those available for each
distinct destination, and for installing each chosen route into the Loc-RIB.
The combination of the Phase 1 and 2 decision functions is characterized as
a Path Vector algorithm.
</t>
<t>
The SPF based Decision process replaces the BGP best-path Decision process described in
<xref target="RFC4271"/>. This process starts with selecting only those Node NLRI whose
SPF capability TLV matches with the local BGP-LS-SPF speaker's SPF capability TLV value.
Since Link-State NLRI always contains the local descriptor
<xref target="RFC7752"/>, it will only
be originated by a single BGP-LS-SPF speaker in the BGP SPF routing domain.
These selected Node NLRI and their Link/Prefix NLRI are used to build a directed
graph during the SPF computation. The best paths for BGP prefixes
are installed as a result of the SPF process.
</t>
<t>
When BGP-LS-SPF NLRI is received, all that is required is to determine
whether it is the best-path by examining the Node-ID and sequence number as described
in <xref target="Phase-1"/>. If the received best-path NLRI had changed, it will be advertised
to other BGP-LS-SPF peers. If the attributes have changed (other than the sequence number),
a BGP SPF calculation will be scheduled. However, a changed NLRI MAY be
advertised to other peers almost immediately and propagation of changes can approach
IGP convergence times.  To accomplish this, the MinRouteAdvertisementIntervalTimer and
MinASOriginationIntervalTimer <xref target="RFC4271"/> are not applicable
to the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI. Rather, SPF calculations SHOULD be triggered and dampened consistent
with the SPF back-off algorithm specified in <xref target="RFC8405"/>.
</t>
<t>
The Phase 3 decision function
of the Decision Process <xref target="RFC4271"/> is also simplified since under
normal SPF operation, a BGP speaker would advertise the NLRI
selected for the SPF to all BGP peers with the BGP-LS/BGP-LS-SPF AFI/SAFI.
Application of policy would not be prevented however its usage to best-path process
would be limited as the SPF relies solely on link metrics.
</t>

<section anchor="Phase-1" title="BGP NLRI Selection">
<t>
  The rules for NLRI selection are greatly simplified from phase 1 of the BGP
  deciscion process <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
<list style="numbers">
<t>
If the NLRI is received from the BGP speaker originating the NLRI (as determined by the
comparing BGP Router ID in the NLRI Node identifiers with the BGP speaker Router ID),
then it is preferred over the same NLRI from non-originators. This rule will assure that
stale NLRI is updated even if a BGP-LS router loses its sequence number state due to a
cold-start.
</t>
<t>
If the Sequence-Number TLV is present in the BGP-LS Attribute, then the NLRI with the
most recent, i.e., highest sequence number is selected. BGP-LS-SPF NLRI with a Sequence-Number
TLV will be considered more recent than NLRI without a BGP-LS Attribute or a
BGP-LS Attribute that doesn't include the Sequence-Number TLV.
</t>
<t>The final tie-breaker is the NLRI from the BGP-LS-SPF speaker with the numerically largest
BGP Router ID.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
When a BGP speaker completely loses its sequence number state, i.e., due to a cold start, or
in the unlikely possibility that that sequence number wraps, the BGP routing domain will
still converge. This is due to the fact that BGP speakers adjacent to the router will
always accept self-originated NLRI from the associated speaker as more recent (rule # 1). When
BGP speaker reestablishes a connection with its peers, any existing session will be taken
down and stale NLRI will be replaced by the new NLRI and stale NLRI will be discarded
independent of whether or not BGP graceful restart is deployed, <xref target="RFC4724"/>. The adjacent
BGP speaker will update their NLRI advertisements in turn until the BGP routing domain has
converged.
</t>
<t>
The modified SPF Decision Process performs an SPF calculation rooted at the BGP
speaker using the metrics from
Link and Prefix NLRI Attribute TLVs <xref target="RFC7752"/>. As a result, any attributes that
would influence the Decision process defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/> like ORIGIN, MULTI_EXIT_DISC, and
LOCAL_PREF attributes are ignored by the SPF algorithm. Furthermore, the NEXT_HOP attribute
value is preserved but otherwise ignored during the SPF or best-path.

        the local node's sequence number for the NLRI), the NLRI sequence number will be advanced to
        one greater than the received sequence number and the NLRI will be readvertised to all peers.
      </t>
      <t>
        If self-origanated NLRI is received and the sequence number is the same as the local node's
        sequence number but the attributes differ,  the NLRI sequence number will be advanced to
        one greater than the received sequence number and the NLRI will be readvertised to all peers.
      </t>
      <t>
        If self-origanated Link or Prefix NLRI is received and the Link or Prefix NLRI is no longer
        being advertised by the local node, the NLRI will be withdrawn.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>
    The above actions are performed immediately when the first instance of a newer self-originated NLRI is
    received. In this case, the newer instance is considered to be a stale instance that was advertised by
    the local node prior to a restart where the NLRI state is lost.  However, if subsequent newer self-originated
    NLRI is received for the same Node, Link, or Prefix NLRI, the readvertisement or withdrawal is delayed
    by 5 seconds since it is likely being advertised by a misconfigured or rouge BGP-LS-SPF speaker.

<t>
The SPF-based decision process operates on Node, Link, and Prefix NLRIs that support
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Whether to run a single SPF instance or multiple
SPF instances for separate AFs is a matter of a local implementation. Normally, IPv4
next-hops are calculated for IPv4 prefixes and IPv6 next-hops are calculated for IPv6
prefixes. However, an interesting use-case is deployment of <xref target="RFC5549"/> where
IPv6 next-hops are calculated for both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. As stated in
<xref target="introduction"/>, support for Multiple Topology Routing (MTR) is an area
for future study.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="BGP-SPF" title="SPF Calculation based on BGP-LS-SPF NLRI">
<t>This section details the BGP-LS-SPF local routing information base (RIB) calculation.
The router will use BGP-LS Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI to populate the local RIB using the
following algorithm. This calculation yields the set of intra-area routes associated
with the BGP-LS domain.  A router calculates the  shortest-path tree using itself
as the root. Variations and optimizations of the algorithm are valid as long as it
yields the same set of routes. The algorithm below supports Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
routes. Weighted Unequal Cost Multi-Path are out of scope. The organization of this section
owes heavily to section 16 of <xref target="RFC2328"/>.</t>
<t>The following abstract data structures are defined in order to specify the algorithm.
<list style="symbols">
<t>Local Route Information Base (RIB) - This is abstract contains reachability information
(i.e., next hops) for all prefixes (both IPv4 and IPv6) as well as the Node NLRI
reachability. Implementations may choose to implement this as separate RIBs for each
address family and/or Node NLRI.</t>
<t>Link State NLRI Database (LSNDB) - Database of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI that facilitates access to
all Node, Link, and Prefix NLRI as well as all the Link and Prefix NLRI corresponding to
a given Node NLRI. Other optimization, such as, resolving bi-directional connectivity
associations between Link NLRI are possible but of scope of this document.</t>
<t>Candidate List - This is a list of candidate Node NLRI with the lowest cost Node NLRI
at the front of the list. It is typically implemented as a heap but other concrete
data structures have also been used.</t>
</list></t>
<t>The algorithm is comprised of the steps below:
<list style="numbers">
<t>The current local RIB is invalidated. The local RIB is
rebuilt during the course of the SPF computation.  The existing routing entries
are preserved for comparison to
determine changes that need to be installed in the global RIB.</t>
<t>The computing router's Node NLRI is installed in the local RIB with a cost of 0 and as
the sole entry in the candidate list.</t>
<t>The Node NLRI with the lowest cost is removed from the candidate list for processing. If
the BGP-LS Node attribute includes an SPF Status TLV (<xref target="node-status-tlv"/>)
indicating the node is unreachable, the Node NLRI is ignored and the next lowest cost
Node NLRI is selected from candidate list. The
Node corresponding to this NLRI will be referred to as the Current Node. If the candidate
list is empty, the SPF calculation has completed and the algorithm proceeds to step 6.</t>
<t>All the Prefix NLRI with the same Node Identifiers as the Current Node will be considered
for installation. The cost for each prefix is the metric advertised in the Prefix NLRI
added to the cost to reach the Current Node.
<list style="symbols">
<t>If the BGP-LS Prefix attribute includes an SPF Status TLV indicating the prefix is
unreachable, the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI is considered unreachable and the next BGP-LS Prefix
NLRI is examined.</t>
<t>If the prefix is in the local RIB and the cost is greater than the Current route's metric,
the Prefix NLRI does not contribute to the route and is ignored.</t>
<t>If the prefix is in the local RIB and the cost is less than the current route's metric,
the Prefix is installed with the Current Node's next-hops replacing the local RIB route's
next-hops and the metric being updated.</t>
<t>If the prefix is in the local RIB and the cost is same as the current route's metric,
the Prefix is installed with the Current Node's next-hops being merged with local
RIB route's next-hops.</t>
</list> </t>
<t>All the Link NLRI with the same Node Identifiers as the Current Node will be considered
for installation. Each link will be examined and will be referred to in the following text
as the Current Link. The cost of the Current Link is the advertised metric in the Link NLRI
added to the cost to reach the Current Node.
<list style="symbols">
<t>Optionally, the prefix(es) associated with the Current Link are installed into the
local RIB using the same rules as were used for Prefix NLRI in the previous steps.</t>
<t>If the current Node NLRI attributes includes the SPF status TLV
(<xref target="node-status-tlv"/>) and the status
indicates that the Node doesn't support transit, the next link for the current node is
processed.</t>
<t>The Current Link's endpoint Node NLRI is accessed (i.e., the Node NLRI
with the same Node identifiers as the Link endpoint). If it exists, it will be referred to
as the Endpoint Node NLRI and the algorithm will proceed as follows:
<list style="symbols">
<t>If the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI attribute includes an SPF Status TLV indicating the link is
down, the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is considered down and the next BGP-LS Link
NLRI is examined.</t>
<t>All the Link NLRI corresponding the Endpoint Node NLRI will be searched for a back-link
NLRI pointing to the current node. Both the Node identifiers and the
Link endpoint identifiers in the Endpoint Node's Link NLRI must match for a match. If there
is no corresponding Link NLRI corresponding to the Endpoint Node NLRI, the Endpoint Node
NLRI fails the bi-directional connectivity test and is not processed further.</t>
<t>If the Endpoint Node NLRI is not on the candidate list, it is inserted based on the
link cost and BGP Identifier (the latter being used as a tie-breaker).</t>
<t>If the Endpoint Node NLRI is already on the candidate list with a lower cost, it need
not be inserted again.</t>
<t>If the Endpoint Node NLRI is already on the candidate list with a higher cost, it must
be removed and reinserted with a lower cost.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Return to step 3 to process the next lowest cost Node NLRI on the candidate list.</t>
</list></t>
<t>The local RIB is examined and changes (adds, deletes, modifications) are installed into
the global RIB.</t>

<section title="NEXT_HOP Manipulation">
<t>
A BGP speaker that supports SPF extensions MAY interact with peers that don't support
SPF extensions. If the BGP-LS address family is advertised to a peer not
supporting the SPF extensions described herein, then the BGP speaker
MUST conform to the NEXT_HOP rules specified in <xref target="RFC4271"/> when announcing
the Link-State address family routes to those peers.
</t>

<t>
  All BGP peers that support SPF extensions would locally compute the Loc-RIB next-hops
  as a result of the SPF process. Consequently, the NEXT_HOP attribute is always ignored on
  receipt. However, BGP speakers SHOULD set the NEXT_HOP address according to the
  NEXT_HOP attribute rules specified in <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
  section 3.4 of <xref target="RFC7752"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="IPv4/IPv6 Unicast Address Family Interaction">
<t>
While the BGP-LS-SPF address family and the IPv4/IPv6 unicast address families install routes
into the same device routing tables, they will operate independently much the same as OSPF and
IS-IS would operate today (i.e., "Ships-in-the-Night" mode). There will be no implicit
route redistribution between the BGP address families. However, implementation specific
redistribution mechanisms SHOULD be made available with the restriction that redistribution
of BGP-LS-SPF routes into the IPv4 address family applies only to IPv4 routes and redistribution
of BGP-LS-SPF route into the IPv6 address family applies only to IPv6 routes.
</t>
<t>
Given the fact that SPF algorithms are based on the assumption that all routers in the
routing domain calculate the precisely the same SPF tree and install the same set of
routes, it is RECOMMENDED that BGP-LS-SPF IPv4/IPv6 routes be given priority by default
when installed into their respective RIBs. In common implementations the prioritization
is governed by route preference or administrative distance with lower being more preferred.
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="NLRI-Advertise" title="NLRI Advertisement and Convergence">
<section anchor="failure-converge" title="Link/Prefix Failure Convergence">
<t>A local failure will prevent a link from being used in the SPF calculation
due to the IGP bi-directional connectivity requirement. Consequently, local link
failures should always be given priority over updates (e.g., withdrawing all
routes learned on a session) in order to ensure the highest priority propagation
and optimal convergence.
</t>
<t>
An IGP such as OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/> will stop using the link as soon as
the Router-LSA for one side of the link is received. With normal BGP advertisement,
the link would continue to be used until the last copy of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI
is withdrawn. In order to avoid this delay, the originator of the Link NLRI will
advertise a more recent version of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI including the SPF Status TLV
<xref target="link-status-tlv"/> indicating the link
is down with respect to BGP SPF. After some configurable period of time, e.g., 2-3 seconds,
the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI can be withdrawn with no consequence.
If the link becomes available
 in that period, the originator of the BGP-LS LINK NLRI will simply advertise a more recent
version of the BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI without the SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Link Attributes.
</t>
<t>Similarly, when a prefix becomes unreachable, a more recent version of the BGP-LS
Prefix NLRI will be advertised with the SPF Status TLV <xref target="prefix-status-tlv"/>
indicating the prefix is unreachable in the BGP-LS Prefix Attributes and the prefix will be
considered unreachable with respect to BGP SPF.  After some configurable period of time, e.g., 2-3 seconds,
the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI can be withdrawn with no consequence.
If the prefix becomes reachable in that period, the originator of the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI
will simply advertise a more recent version of the BGP-LS-SPF Prefix NLRI without the
SPF Status TLV in the BGP-LS Prefix Attributes.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="node-failure" title="Node Failure Convergence">
<t>With BGP without graceful restart <xref target="RFC4724"/>, all the NLRI advertised
by node are implicitly withdrawn when a session failure is detected. If fast failure
detection such as BFD is utilized, and the node is on the fastest converging path, the most
recent versions of BGP-LS-SPF NLRI may be withdrawn while these versions are in-flight on longer
paths. This will result the older version of the NLRI being used until the new versions
arrive and, potentially, unnecessary route flaps. Therefore, BGP-LS-SPF NLRI SHOULD always
be retained before being implicitly withdrawn for a brief configurable interval, e.g., 2-3
seconds. This will not delay convergence since the adjacent nodes will detect the
link failure and advertise a more recent NLRI indicating the link is down with respect to
BGP SPF <xref target="failure-converge"/> and the BGP SPF calculation will failure the
bi-directional connectivity check.

   <list style="numbers">
     <t>
       Does the sum of all TLVs found in the BGP MP_REACH_NLRI attribute

  When the error determined allows for the router to skip the malformed

  (e.g. when the TLV ordering rule is violated), then it MUST handle
  such malformed NLRIs as 'Treat-as-withdraw'.  In other cases, where
  the error in the NLRI encoding results in the inability to process
  the BGP update message (e.g., length related encoding errors), then
  the router SHOULD handle such malformed NLRIs as 'AFI/SAFI disable'
  when other AFI/SAFI besides BGP-LS are being advertised over the same
  session.  Alternately, the router MUST perform 'session reset' when
  the session is only being used for BGP-LS-SPF or when it 'AFI/SAFI

   Note that the 'Attribute Discard' action results in the loss of all

   wrong indication to a BGP-LS-SPF speaker of that specific information
   being deleted or not available.

<t>
   When a BGP-LS-SPF speaker receives an update message with Link-State NLRI(s)
   in the MP_REACH_NLRI but without the BGP-LS-SPF Attribute, it is most
   likely an indication that a BGP-LS-SPF speaker preceding it has performed
   the 'Attribute Discard' fault handling.  An implementation SHOULD
   preserve and propagate the Link-State NLRIs in such an update message
   so that the BGP-LS-SPF speaker can detect the loss of link-state
   information for that object and not assume its deletion/withdraw.
   This also makes it possible for a network operator to trace back to
   the BGP-LS-SPF speaker which actually detected a fault with the BGP-LS

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
This document defines a new BGP SAFI, i.e., the BGP-LS-SPF SAFI. This document
does not change the underlying security issues inherent in the BGP protocol
<xref target="RFC4271"/>. The Security Considerations
discused in <xref target="RFC4271"/> applies to the BGP SPF functionality as well.
The analysis of the security issues for BGP mentioned
in <xref target="RFC4272"/> and <xref target="RFC6952"/> also applies to this document.
The analysis of Generic Threats to Routing Protocols done in <xref target="RFC4593"/>
is also worth noting. As the modifications described in this document for
BGP SPF apply to IPv4 Unicast and IPv6 Unicast as undelay AFIs in a single
BGP SPF Routing Domain, the BGP
security solutions described in <xref target="RFC6811"/> and <xref target="RFC8205"/>
are somewhat constricted as they are meant to apply for inter-domain BGP where
mutiple BGP Routing Domains are typically involved. The BGP-LS-SPF SAFI NLRI described
in this document are usually advertised between EBGP or IBGP speakers under a single
administrative domain.
</t>
<t>
In the context of the BGP peerings associated with this document, a
BGP speaker MUST NOT accept updates from a peer that is not within
any adminstrative control of an operator. That is, a participating
BGP speaker SHOULD be aware of the nature of its peering relationships.
Such protection can be achieved by manual configuration of peers
at the BGP speaker.
</t>
<t>
  In order to mitigate the risk of peering with BGP speakers masquerading
  as legitimate authorized BGP speakers, it is recommended that the
  The TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925"/> be used to
  authenticate BGP sessions. If an authorized BGP peer is compromised, that
  BGP peer could advertise modified Node, Link, or Prefix NLRI will result
  in misrouting, repeating origination of NLRI, and/or excessive SPF
  calculations. When a BGP speaker detects that its self-originated NLRI
  is being originated by another BGP speaker, an appropriate error should
  be logged so that the operator can take corrective action.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629;
        here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI
        "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds:
          include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included
    files in the same directory as the including file. You can also define
    the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be
    either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
